# Expression Manager

A simple implementation of an expression manager to faciliate convereting between infix and postfix notation.

### Description

I originally built this project to pass off the requirements for a class assignment. It is a classic implementation of a expression manager.

### Explanatory Note

I created this project before I learned better practices. As such, it's not my best work, but it does help demonstrate the creativity I had even when I was learning.

### Instructions
A test driver is supplied. This tests the code to verify that it passes the requirements for the given assignment.
